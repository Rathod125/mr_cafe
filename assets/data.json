        "Italian dessert prepared by pouring a double ristratto over 2 scoops of vanilla icecream.",
        "Prepared by steeping coffee with cold water overnight. This coffee is less acidic & has 67% less coffee oils.",
        "It is little less intense than the Espresso tonic,we use Cold Brew instead of Espresso to prepare this drink.",
        "A refreshing fizzy drink prepared by pouring a shot of espresso over ice & tonic water. \n'A virtual treat",
        "A shot of espresso is pulled directly over ice. This coffee is prepared in a way to highlight the bright notes of Espresso.",
        "This coffee is for the ones with a sweet tooth, generous amount of condensed milk is added to cold brew to make a sweet yet strong coffee."
